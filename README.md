# Pandas Practice Project

## Introduction

This repository contains my practice exercises and solutions for learning the **Pandas** module in Python. Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, and through these exercises, I explored various features and functionalities provided by Pandas to handle and analyze datasets effectively.

## Features

- Data Loading and Cleaning
- Handling Missing Data
- Filtering and Sorting Data
- Data Aggregation and Grouping
- Merging and Joining DataFrames
- Reshaping Data (Pivot and Melt)
- Time Series Analysis

## Topics Covered

1. **DataFrames and Series**  
   Basic creation and manipulation of Pandas DataFrames and Series.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and modifying columns and rows.

3. **Data Transformation**  
   Sorting, filtering, and modifying data efficiently.

4. **Aggregation and Grouping**  
   Using `groupby()`, `aggregate()`, and other functions for advanced data aggregation.

5. **Merging and Joining**  
   Combining multiple DataFrames using joins and merges.

6. **Reshaping Data**  
   Using `pivot()`, `melt()`, and other reshaping techniques.

7. **Time Series Analysis**  
   Working with time-indexed data for time series analysis.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook / IDE

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pandas-practice-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pandas-practice-project
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook files or Python scripts to view and run the exercises.

## Project Structure

```plaintext
├── data/                # Sample datasets used for practice
├── notebooks/           # Jupyter Notebooks containing the exercises and solutions
├── scripts/             # Python scripts for various Pandas operations
├── README.md            # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt     # List of dependencies (optional)
```

## Sample Datasets

The `data/` directory contains sample datasets that were used for the exercises, including CSV files and other formats that showcase real-world use cases for Pandas.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my progress in learning Pandas. Feel free to explore the code, try out the examples, and experiment with your own datasets. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
